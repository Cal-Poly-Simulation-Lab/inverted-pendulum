# Inverted Pendulum: Dynamics & Control
Objective: To explore the dynamics and control of an inverted pendulum by designing and integrating a model-based control system to achieve a self-stabilizing system. This project will involve parameter optimization, simulation, implementation of a state-space controller, and CAD files for printing.

All files will be updated as the the project develops.
